# Model Mismatch Fix Summary

## Issue Description
There was a persistent mismatch between the backend and frontend model handling in Gary-Zero:
- **Backend**: Stored `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` as the browser model value
- **Frontend**: Displayed "Claude Sonnet 4" but sent the old deprecated model ID
- **Validation**: Backend correctly rejected the deprecated model as it wasn't in the approved MODEL_CATALOG

## Root Cause
1. The DEFAULT_SETTINGS in `framework/helpers/settings/types.py` contained an outdated model value
2. No migration system existed to update deprecated model names to their modern equivalents
3. Settings loaded from storage retained old model identifiers that were no longer valid

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Default Settings
- Changed `browser_model_name` from `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` to `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
- This ensures new installations use the correct modern model

### 2. Created Migration System
- Added `framework/helpers/settings/migrate.py` with:
  - `MODEL_MIGRATIONS` map of deprecated models to modern replacements
  - `migrate_settings()` function to update model names
  - `needs_migration()` function to check if migration is required

### 3. Integrated Migration into Settings Loading
- Modified `get_settings()` in `framework/helpers/settings/api.py` to:
  - Check if loaded settings need migration
  - Automatically migrate deprecated models
  - Save the migrated settings back to disk

## Migration Map Includes
- Anthropic: `claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022` → `claude-3-5-sonnet-latest`
- OpenAI: `gpt-4` → `gpt-4.1`
- Google: `gemini-1.5-pro` → `gemini-2.5-pro`
- And more...

## Testing
Created and ran `test_model_migration.py` which confirmed:
- Migration correctly detects deprecated models
- Models are properly updated to modern equivalents
- Migrated models pass validation checks

## Benefits
1. **Automatic Updates**: Users with old settings will have their models automatically updated
2. **Future-Proof**: Easy to add new migrations as models are deprecated
3. **Transparent**: Migration logs show what was updated
4. **Consistent**: Ensures frontend and backend use the same model identifiers
