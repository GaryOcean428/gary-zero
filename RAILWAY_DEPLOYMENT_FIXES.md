# Railway Deployment Fixes - Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Browser `process is not defined` Errors ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** Frontend code in `webui/js/console-logger.js` was using `process?.env?.NODE_ENV` which is undefined in the browser environment.

**Fix:** Implemented browser-safe development detection:
- Removed direct `process.env` usage in browser code
- Added hostname-based detection (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, etc.)
- Added port-based detection for common development ports
- Kept Node.js compatibility for build scripts with proper guards

**File:** `webui/js/console-logger.js` line 14-32

### 2. Missing `/api/health` Endpoint ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** Railway deployment expected `/api/health` endpoint but only `/health`, `/healthz`, `/ready` existed.

**Fix:** Added comprehensive `/api/health` endpoint to main.py:
- Returns system metrics (CPU, memory usage)
- Includes Railway environment information
- Proper error handling with 503 status on failure
- Uses HealthResponse Pydantic model for validation

**Files:** 
- `main.py` lines 326-350 (endpoint)
- `main.py` lines 47-55 (HealthResponse model)

### 3. Incorrect Health Check Configuration ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** `railpack.json` was configured to use `/health` but Railway best practices require `/api/health`.

**Fix:** Updated railpack.json:
- Changed `healthcheckPath` from `/health` to `/api/health`
- Maintained existing PORT and environment variable configuration

**File:** `railpack.json` line 79

### 4. Conflicting Deployment Configurations ❌ → ✅

**Problem:** Multiple deployment configs (Dockerfile, railway.json) competing with railpack.json.

**Fix:** Removed conflicting files:
- Deleted root `Dockerfile` 
- Deleted `railway.json` with NIXPACKS builder config
- Kept intentional Docker files in `docker/` subdirectory

**Removed Files:**
- `Dockerfile` (root level)
- `railway.json`

## Deployment Process

Railway will now:
1. Use `railpack.json` as the primary deployment configuration
2. Build using Node.js and Python providers
3. Install dependencies via yarn and pip
4. Start the application using the configured start command
5. Health check the `/api/health` endpoint
6. No more browser `process is not defined` errors

## Testing Performed

✅ **Console Logger:** Verified browser-safe development detection works  
✅ **Health Endpoints:** Tested both `/health` and `/api/health` respond correctly  
✅ **Main App Import:** Confirmed main.py imports and routes are registered  
✅ **Configuration Validation:** All JSON configs validated  
✅ **Conflict Resolution:** Verified conflicting files are removed  

## Files Modified

1. `webui/js/console-logger.js` - Fixed browser process.env usage
2. `main.py` - Added /api/health endpoint and HealthResponse model
3. `railpack.json` - Updated healthcheckPath to /api/health
4. `.yarnrc.yml` - Removed deprecated networkTimeout setting
5. **Removed:** `Dockerfile`, `railway.json` (conflicting configs)

## Expected Outcome

- ✅ Railway deployment succeeds without errors
- ✅ Frontend loads without `process is not defined` errors  
- ✅ Health checks pass at `/api/health`
- ✅ Application starts correctly using railpack.json configuration
- ✅ All browser-side JavaScript works properly

The deployment should now be Railway-compatible with proper health monitoring and error-free frontend operation.
