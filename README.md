## A personal, organic agentic framework that grows and learns with you

- Gary-Zero is not a predefined agentic framework. It is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and learning as you use it.
- Gary-Zero is fully transparent, readable, comprehensible, customizable, and interactive.
- Gary-Zero uses the computer as a tool to accomplish its (your) tasks.

# 💡 Key Features

1. **General-purpose Assistant**

- Gary-Zero is not pre-programmed for specific tasks (but can be). It is meant to be a general-purpose personal assistant. Give it a task, and it will gather information, execute commands and code, cooperate with other agent instances, and do its best to accomplish it.
- It has a persistent memory, allowing it to memorize previous solutions, code, facts, instructions, etc., to solve tasks faster and more reliably in the future.

![Agent 0 Working](/docs/res/ui-screen-2.png)

2. **Computer as a Tool**

- Gary-Zero uses the operating system as a tool to accomplish its tasks. It has no single-purpose tools pre-programmed. Instead, it can write its own code and use the terminal to create and use its own tools as needed.
- The only default tools in its arsenal are online search, memory features, communication (with the user and other agents), and code/terminal execution. Everything else is created by the agent itself or can be extended by the user.
- Tool usage functionality has been developed from scratch to be the most compatible and reliable, even with very small models.
- **Default Tools:** Gary-Zero includes tools like knowledge, webpage content, code execution, and communication.
- **Creating Custom Tools:** Extend Gary-Zero's functionality by creating your own custom tools.
- **Instruments:** Instruments are a new type of tool that allow you to create custom functions and procedures that can be called by Gary-Zero.

3. **Multi-agent Cooperation**

- Every agent has a superior agent giving it tasks and instructions. Every agent then reports back to its superior.
- In the case of the first agent in the chain (Agent 0), the superior is the human user; the agent sees no difference.
- Every agent can create its subordinate agent to help break down and solve subtasks. This helps all agents keep their context clean and focused.

![Multi-agent](docs/res/physics.png)
![Multi-agent 2](docs/res/physics-2.png)

4. **Completely Customizable and Extensible**

- Almost nothing in this framework is hard-coded. Nothing is hidden. Everything can be extended or changed by the user.
- The whole behavior is defined by a system prompt in the **prompts/default/agent.system.md** file. Change this prompt and change the framework dramatically.
- The framework does not guide or limit the agent in any way. There are no hard-coded rails that agents have to follow.
- Every prompt, every small message template sent to the agent in its communication loop can be found in the **prompts/** folder and changed.
- Every default tool can be found in the **python/tools/** folder and changed or copied to create new predefined tools.

![Prompts](/docs/res/prompts.png)

5. **Communication is Key**

- Give your agent a proper system prompt and instructions, and it can do miracles.
- Agents can communicate with their superiors and subordinates, asking questions, giving instructions, and providing guidance. Instruct your agents in the system prompt on how to communicate effectively.
- The terminal interface is real-time streamed and interactive. You can stop and intervene at any point. If you see your agent heading in the wrong direction, just stop and tell it right away.
- There is a lot of freedom in this framework. You can instruct your agents to regularly report back to superiors asking for permission to continue. You can instruct them to use point-scoring systems when deciding when to delegate subtasks. Superiors can double-check subordinates' results and dispute. The possibilities are endless.


## 🚀 Things you can build with Gary-Zero

- **Development Projects** - `"Create a React dashboard with real-time data visualization"`

- **Data Analysis** - `"Analyze last quarter's NVIDIA sales data and create trend reports"`

- **Content Creation** - `"Write a technical blog post about microservices"`

- **System Admin** - `"Set up a monitoring system for our web servers"`

- **Research** - `"Gather and summarize five recent AI papers about CoT prompting"`

# Hacking Edition

- Gary-Zero also offers a Hacking Edition based on Kali linux with modified prompts for cybersecurity tasks
- The setup is the same as the regular version, just use the frdel/gary-zero-run:hacking image instead of frdel/gary-zero-run
> **Note:** The Hacking Edition and all its prompts and features will be merged into the main branch in the following release.

[![Easy Installation guide](/docs/res/easy_ins_vid.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L1_peV8szf8)

A detailed setup guide for Windows, macOS, and Linux with a video can be found in the Gary-Zero Documentation at [this page](./docs/installation.md).

### ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Pull and run with Docker (Warp 2.0 Compatible)

docker pull frdel/gary-zero-run
# Use Warp 2.0 frontend port range (5675-5699)
docker run -p 5675:80 frdel/gary-zero-run

# Visit http://localhost:5675 to start
```

### 🚄 Railway Deployment Quick-Check

**Before every Railway deployment, run this 8-step checklist:**

#### 1. Pull Latest Code

```bash
git pull origin main
```

#### 2. Verify Port Configuration

```bash
# Check Warp 2.0 port assignments
grep -E "PORT=|WEB_UI_PORT=" .env.example
# Frontend: 5675-5699 | Backend: 8765-8799
```

#### 3. Railway Configuration Check

```bash
# Verify railway.toml has correct port bindings
grep -A5 "\[environment\]" railway.toml
```

#### 4. Environment Variables Validation

```bash
# Ensure no hardcoded secrets in .env.example
grep -i "password\|secret\|key" .env.example | grep -v "your_"
```

#### 5. Inter-Service URLs Check

```bash
# Look for localhost references that should use Railway variables
grep -r "localhost:" --exclude="*.md" --exclude-dir=node_modules .
```

#### 6. Deploy & Verify

```bash
railway up
# Check Railway dashboard → Service → Logs for:
# "Listening on 0.0.0.0:8765" (backend)
```

#### 7. Health Check

```bash
# Test deployed endpoints
curl -f https://your-service.up.railway.app/healthz
```

#### 8. Final Verification

- ✅ Port ranges enforced (Frontend: 5675-5699, Backend: 8765-8799)
- ✅ No hardcoded localhost URLs
- ✅ Railway reference variables used
- ✅ No secrets in .env.example
- ✅ Service responds on correct ports

> **Pro Tip:** Use `npm run dev` (port 5675) for frontend development and `npm run dev:backend` (port 8765) for backend services.


## 🐳 Fully Dockerized, with Speech-to-Text and TTS

![Settings](docs/res/settings-page-ui.png)

- Customizable settings allow users to tailor the agent's behavior and responses to their needs.
- The Web UI output is very clean, fluid, colorful, readable, and interactive; nothing is hidden.
- You can load or save chats directly within the Web UI.
- The same output you see in the terminal is automatically saved to an HTML file in **logs/** folder for every session.

![Time example](/docs/res/time_example.jpg)

- Agent output is streamed in real-time, allowing users to read along and intervene at any time.
- No coding is required; only prompting and communication skills are necessary.
- With a solid system prompt, the framework is reliable even with small models, including precise tool usage.


## 👀 Keep in Mind

1. **Gary-Zero Can Be Dangerous!**

- With proper instruction, Gary-Zero is capable of many things, even potentially dangerous actions concerning your computer, data, or accounts. Always run Gary-Zero in an isolated environment (like Docker) and be careful what you wish for.

2. **Gary-Zero Is Prompt-based.**

- The whole framework is guided by the **prompts/** folder. Agent guidelines, tool instructions, messages, utility AI functions, it's all there.

## 🚀 CI/CD Architecture

Gary-Zero features a modern, modular CI/CD pipeline built around 4 reusable composite workflows:

### 🧩 Composite Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose | Components |
|----------|---------|------------|
| **A. Static Checks** | Code quality & consistency | Ruff, Black, MyPy, ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript, Secret scanning |
| **B. Tests** | Comprehensive testing | Unit, Integration, E2E, Performance, Coverage reporting |
| **C. Security Audit** | Multi-layer security scanning | Bandit, Safety, npm audit, Trivy, OSSF Scorecard |
| **D. Deploy** | Production deployment | Railway validation, Docker build, CLI deployment |

### 🔄 Usage Patterns

- **Feature Branches**: Uses workflows A + B (static checks + tests)
- **Main Branch**: Uses full pipeline A + B + C + D (complete CI/CD)
- **Quality Gate**: All checks must pass before deployment
- **Railway Integration**: Automated deployment with health verification
